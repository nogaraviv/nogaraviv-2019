          <p>Particle is small team of developers based in San Francisco specializing in mobile app development. I worked closely with the founder of the company to create an identity that symbolized a high-speed and interactive brand.</p>
          <p>I renamed the company (originally “Base Apps”), created their logo, and designed their styleguide.</p>
