        <p>In June 2018 BuzzFeed News launched a new news destination separate from its previous home on buzzfeed.com, with an entirely
          new look . At launch, we released a 1) new logo and brand, and 2) a new homepage and article pages. We also included
          some new features including an algorithmic trending section that effectively served as the new navigation for the website.</p>
